# Attendance-Management-Application
Creating an Attendance Management System where system can take attendance automatically by using QR Scanner code.
Here I created two application, first desktop application and second android application.
The desktop application is specially desinged for smart boards that majorly used in colleges & school.
This application developed for teachers where we show the regular timetable of lectures with taking attendance for every lecture by generating QR code
and the android application is designed for students in which the application scan the QR code provided by desktop application and mark the attendance and the desktop based application shows
overall students present in the class and store that data to database. Hence this attendance management system makes an easier way to take attendance.
